THIS CODE IS DIRTY because I didn't originally think of making it public. But a friend saw how it worked and wanted to use it too, so then I figured that maybe other people will want to use it too.

This script reads your profile and posts from Pixelfed (on the Fediverse) and Bluesky (Atproto) and adds up followers and post likes. Very similar to what politicalmemes.org does on those profiles. This way, you can share your website rather than separate Fedi and Atproto profiles to people, and they can see what you post without logging in and click to the network they prefer.

This project is open source and you are very welcome to make changes to your desires/needs. Have fun with it!
